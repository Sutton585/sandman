task: Task_13
status: Pending Review
target_terms: [min_age_hours, rescrape_after]
new_term: rescrape_threshold_hours
context: "We have decoupled age filtering from maturity logic. min_age_hours is now a strict filter that discards young posts across all modules. A new parameter, rescrape_threshold_hours, is now responsible for triggering the maturity logic in reddit2md (queueing young posts with a rescrape_after timestamp)."

# Documentation Scrubbing Report for Task_13

> **Instructions**: Review the `AI Analysis` and `Proposed Rewrite` for each block below. If accurate, apply the rewrite to the source file.

---

## File: `README.md` (Block #21)
**Original:**
```markdown
### Age Restrictions (`min_age_hours` / `max_age_hours`)
Sandman allows you to filter the data you extract based on its age.
- **`min_age_hours`**: The minimum time a post or listing must exist before it is considered valid or mature. In Reddit, this triggers the "Maturity Logic" (queueing young posts for a re-scrape later). In Jobs, it directly filters out posts that are too new.
- **`max_age_hours`**: The maximum age of a post to be considered relevant. Anything older than this limit is entirely ignored by the scrapers.
```

**Original:**
```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **`jobs2md`**: Maps `max_age_hours` to JobSpy's native `hours_old` parameter.
- [ ] **`jobs2md`**: Implements post-scrape filtering on the resulting pandas DataFrame to drop any jobs that are younger than `min_age_hours`.
- [ ] **`reddit2md`**: Continues to use `min_age_hours` to queue posts for future rescrapes via `rescrape_after`.
- [ ] **`reddit2md`**: Implements a check against `created_utc` during iteration. If a post's age exceeds `max_age_hours`, it is immediately discarded/skipped.

```markdown
## File: `tasks.md` (Block #51)
**Original:**
```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **`jobs2md`**: Standardize `detail` as a boolean flag (default `false`). Do not alter `reddit2md`'s enum-based `detail` implementation.
- [ ] **`jobs2md`**: During front-matter generation, always inject the `rescrape_after: ` key.
- [ ] **`jobs2md`**: If `detail` is `false` during the scrape, leave `rescrape_after:` empty.
- [ ] **Orchestrator Logic**: Implement a pre-run scan in `jobs2md` that checks existing Markdown files in the output directory. If a file has a populated `rescrape_after` timestamp that is in the past:
  - Extract the job's URL.
  - Execute a targeted JobSpy scrape for that specific URL with `detail: true` (mapping to `linkedin_fetch_description: True`).
  - Overwrite/update the markdown file with the full description and clear the `rescrape_after` field.

**Original:**
```markdown
## File: `nomenclature2.md` (Block #10)
**Original:**
```markdown
**Investigation & Guidance:**
- **JobSpy Reality Check**: JobSpy supports `hours_old` which fetches jobs posted *within* the last X hours. This is actually a **`max_age_hours`** analog, not a minimum age. 
- **Code Change Strategy:**
  1. **Job2md**: Map `max_age_hours` to JobSpy's `hours_old`. To support `min_age_hours`, we will need to filter the resulting pandas DataFrame post-scrape (e.g., dropping rows where the calculated age is less than `min_age_hours`).
  2. **Reddit2md**: PRAW's `.new()` or `.hot()` doesn't natively filter by age. We already filter by `min_age_hours`. To support `max_age_hours`, we will add a condition during iteration checking `created_utc`; if the post is older than `max_age_hours`, we can `break` or `continue`.

### AI Analysis & Updated Plan:
- **Understanding**: You want absolute confirmation that parity will be achieved for both parameters in both modules.
- **Review**: Yes, full parity is entirely achievable and is the goal. 
- **New Plan**: 
  - **job2md**: Implement both. `max_age_hours` will natively map to JobSpy's `hours_old`. `min_age_hours` will be implemented by actively filtering the JobSpy DataFrame output after the initial scrape completes.
  - **reddit2md**: Implement both. We already have the logic for `min_age_hours` (for rescrape queuing). We will add explicit logic for `max_age_hours` to simply skip and discard posts that are too old.

## File: `workspace/_helpers/task_reports/Task_8_impact_report.md` (Block #112)
**Original:**
```markdown
## File: `nomenclature2.md` (Block #64)
**Original:**
```markdown
### AI Analysis & Updated Plan:
- **Understanding**: 
  1. You want to repurpose the `detail` parameter across modules: in `reddit2md` it controls comment depth, while in `jobs2md` it will serve as a boolean flag dictating whether to fetch full job descriptions (specifically for LinkedIn).
  2. You want to port the `rescrape_after` workflow from `reddit2md` over to `jobs2md`. In `reddit2md`, immature posts get stamped with `rescrape_after: <timestamp>` so the system knows to re-fetch and expand them later. In `jobs2md`, if a job is scraped shallowly (`detail: false`), it should output the markdown with an empty `rescrape_after:` field. If the user later decides they want the full job description, they populate that field manually, triggering the orchestrator to re-scrape that specific job with `detail: true`.
- **Review**: This is a brilliant, cohesive architecture. Using the Markdown files themselves as a two-way interface/database queue is extremely powerful. It keeps initial scrapes fast while giving the user granular, on-demand control over data hydration.
- **New Plan**: 
  - Standardize `detail` across modules: as a boolean in `jobs2md` (default: false), and as an enum/size string in `reddit2md`.
  - In `jobs2md` front-matter generation, always include the `rescrape_after: ` key. If `detail: false` during the run, leave it blank.
  - Implement orchestrator logic for `jobs2md` that scans existing Markdown outputs. If it finds a populated, past-due `rescrape_after` field, it parses the `post_url`, fires a targeted JobSpy request with `detail: true` (which maps to `linkedin_fetch_description: True`), and updates the Markdown file.
```

## Proof of concept usage from Sandman layer
Sandman layer uses the same interfaces (python, CLI, config files, etc.) so just like we can queue our default routine and global settings defaults in our config file in the module, we can do the same in sandman like so:
```yaml
{
    "settings": {
        "debug": false,
        "md_output_directory": "../../workspace/feeds/reddit",
        "md_log": "../../workspace/data/reddit/scrape_log.md",
        "data_output_directory": "../../workspace/data/reddit/",
        "group_by_source": true,
        "min_age_hours": 0,
        "min_score": 20,
        "max_results": 10,
    },
    routine: [
        {
            "name": "Python-related jobs from indeed and glassdoor",

1. Config (Settings Management): Handles the logic for merging `settings` with task-specific settings and applying CLI/Python overrides based on the Precedence Order. Validates parameter types.
2. Client (Network Operations): Strictly isolates API and network logic. Manages authentication, headers (e.g., browser-mimicking), rate limiting, and pagination. It should return raw or semi-raw data.
3. Processor (Data Sanitization & Translation): The pure data translation layer. It takes the messy API response from the Client and strictly maps it to the "Standard Schema". It also handles the logic for internal Obsidian link resolution.
4. DatabaseManager (State Tracking): Manages the SQLite index. Responsible for cache pruning, maintaining the `rescrape_after` maturity logic, and executing the State Reconciliation Flow on startup.
5. Scraper / Orchestrator (The Execution Loop): The main entry point. Iterates through the routine queue, coordinates the Config, Client, Processor, and DatabaseManager, and ultimately writes the final Markdown and JSON files to the disk using a Theme Engine / Templates.

**Original:**
```markdown
1. Config (Settings Management): Handles the logic for merging `settings` with task-specific settings and applying CLI/Python overrides based on the Precedence Order. Validates parameter types.
2. Client (Network Operations): Strictly isolates API and network logic. Manages authentication, headers (e.g., browser-mimicking), rate limiting, and pagination. It should return raw or semi-raw data.
3. Processor (Data Sanitization & Translation): The pure data translation layer. It takes the messy API response from the Client and strictly maps it to the "Standard Schema". It also handles the logic for internal Obsidian link resolution.
4. DatabaseManager (State Tracking): Manages the SQLite index. Responsible for cache pruning, maintaining the `rescrape_after` maturity logic, and executing the State Reconciliation Flow on startup.
5. Scraper / Orchestrator (The Execution Loop): The main entry point. Iterates through the routine queue, coordinates the Config, Client, Processor, and DatabaseManager, and ultimately writes the final Markdown and JSON files to the disk using a Theme Engine / Templates.

Scrapers must allow users to suppress side effects or limit footprints:
- save_json (Boolean): Whether to persist the sanitized JSON data after processing.
- md_log (Boolean): Whether to append the run results to the human-readable Markdown log.
- db_limit (Integer): Maximum number of records to keep in the SQLite index. Older records are pruned to keep the database size manageable.
- min_age_hours (Integer): Setting this to 0 must disable all maturity/re-scraping logic, making every scrape final.

### D. DatabaseManager (State Tracking)
Acts as the high-speed SQLite cache (`database.db`).
- Tracks: `id`, `title`, `author`, `source`, `label`, `score`, `post_timestamp`, `file_path`, and `rescrape_after`.
- Controls the footprint limit using `db_limit`, deleting the oldest unneeded records automatically.
- Facilitates the "State Reconciliation Flow" on startup by comparing DB records against the physical `.md` files.

Scrapers must allow users to suppress side effects or limit footprints:
- save_json (Boolean): Whether to persist the sanitized JSON data after processing.
- md_log (Boolean): Whether to append the run results to the human-readable Markdown log.
- db_limit (Integer): Maximum number of records to keep in the SQLite index. Older records are pruned to keep the database size manageable.
- min_age_hours (Integer): Setting this to 0 must disable all maturity/re-scraping logic, making every scrape final.

### D. DatabaseManager (State Tracking)
Acts as the high-speed SQLite cache (`database.db`).
- Tracks: `id`, `title`, `author`, `source`, `label`, `score`, `post_timestamp`, `file_path`, and `rescrape_after`.
- Controls the footprint limit using `db_limit`, deleting the oldest unneeded records automatically.
- Facilitates the "State Reconciliation Flow" on startup by comparing DB records against the physical `.md` files.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **`jobs2md`**: Maps `max_age_hours` to JobSpy's native `hours_old` parameter.
- [ ] **`jobs2md`**: Implements post-scrape filtering on the resulting pandas DataFrame to drop any jobs that are younger than `min_age_hours`.
- [ ] **`reddit2md`**: Continues to use `min_age_hours` to queue posts for future rescrapes via `rescrape_after`.
- [ ] **`reddit2md`**: Implements a check against `created_utc` during iteration. If a post's age exceeds `max_age_hours`, it is immediately discarded/skipped.

**Investigation & Guidance:**
- **JobSpy Reality Check**: JobSpy supports `hours_old` which fetches jobs posted *within* the last X hours. This is actually a **`max_age_hours`** analog, not a minimum age. 
- **Code Change Strategy:**
  1. **Job2md**: Map `max_age_hours` to JobSpy's `hours_old`. To support `min_age_hours`, we will need to filter the resulting pandas DataFrame post-scrape (e.g., dropping rows where the calculated age is less than `min_age_hours`).
  2. **Reddit2md**: PRAW's `.new()` or `.hot()` doesn't natively filter by age. We already filter by `min_age_hours`. To support `max_age_hours`, we will add a condition during iteration checking `created_utc`; if the post is older than `max_age_hours`, we can `break` or `continue`.

### AI Analysis & Updated Plan:
- **Understanding**: You want absolute confirmation that parity will be achieved for both parameters in both modules.
- **Review**: Yes, full parity is entirely achievable and is the goal. 
- **New Plan**: 
  - **job2md**: Implement both. `max_age_hours` will natively map to JobSpy's `hours_old`. `min_age_hours` will be implemented by actively filtering the JobSpy DataFrame output after the initial scrape completes.
  - **reddit2md**: Implement both. We already have the logic for `min_age_hours` (for rescrape queuing). We will add explicit logic for `max_age_hours` to simply skip and discard posts that are too old.

## Proof of concept usage from Sandman layer
Sandman layer uses the same interfaces (python, CLI, config files, etc.) so just like we can queue our default routine and global settings defaults in our config file in the module, we can do the same in sandman like so:
```yaml
{
    "settings": {
        "debug": false,
        "md_output_directory": "../../workspace/feeds/reddit",
        "md_log": "../../workspace/data/reddit/scrape_log.md",
        "data_output_directory": "../../workspace/data/reddit/",
        "group_by_source": true,
        "min_age_hours": 0,
        "min_score": 20,
        "max_results": 10,
    },
    routine: [
        {
            "name": "Python-related jobs from indeed and glassdoor",
            "module": "jobs2md",
            "sources": ["indeed", "glassdoor"],
            "query": "python",
            "max_age_days": 14,
            "is_remote": true
        },
        {
            "name": "Docker-related jobs from indeed and glassdoor",
            "module": "jobs2md",
            "sources": ["linkedIn"],
            "query": "Docker",
            "max_results": 10,
            "is_remote": true
        }
    ]
}
```
```

### Context vs. Freshness (Maturity Logic)
To balance the need for immediate updates with the desire for deep context, modules must implement Maturity Logic.
1. Fresh Scrape: A new post is scraped immediately but marked with a future rescrape_after timestamp in the DB and the Markdown front-matter.
2. Maturation: Once that time passes, the module re-fetches the thread, updates the metadata (e.g., new score/metrics), and appends the finalized conversation to the file.
3. Disablement: Setting min_age_hours to 0 must disable this entirely, making every scrape final.

## Proof of concept usage from Sandman layer
Sandman layer uses the same interfaces (python, CLI, config files, etc.) so just like we can queue our default routine and global settings defaults in our config file in the module, we can do the same in sandman like so:
```yaml
{
    "settings": {
        "debug": false,
        "md_output_directory": "../../workspace/feeds/reddit",
        "md_log": "../../workspace/data/reddit/scrape_log.md",
        "data_output_directory": "../../workspace/data/reddit/",
        "group_by_source": true,
        "min_age_hours": 0,
        "min_score": 20,
        "max_results": 10,
    },
    routine: [
        {
            "name": "Python-related jobs from indeed and glassdoor",
            "module": "jobs2md",
            "sources": ["indeed", "glassdoor"],
            "query": "python",
            "max_age_days": 14,
            "is_remote": true
        },
        {
            "name": "Docker-related jobs from indeed and glassdoor",
            "module": "jobs2md",
            "sources": ["linkedIn"],
            "query": "Docker",
            "max_results": 10,
            "is_remote": true
        }
    ]

## 2. Key Limitation & Technical Strategy
**Limitation:** Scraping Reddit without Official API Access (No OAuth tokens).
- **Discovery via RSS:** Standard `.json` index feeds for subreddits are heavily rate-limited and cached when accessed without an API key. To bypass this, the Client uses Reddit's `.rss` endpoints (e.g., `reddit.com/r/python/new/.rss`) to discover new `post_id`s reliably.
- **Deep Fetch via JSON:** Once a `post_id` is discovered via RSS, the Client fetches the full thread (including comments) using the individual post's `.json` endpoint (e.g., `reddit.com/comments/{post_id}.json`), which is less restricted.
- **Graceful Degradation:** The network client gracefully detects if the external `requests` library is installed. If available, it utilizes `requests` to bypass advanced anti-bot measures (e.g., Reddit's 403 Forbidden blocks). If not, it falls back to the standard library `urllib`.
- **Maturity Logic (The Living Note):** Implements a `min_age_hours` check. Threads scraped while young are marked as "Maturing" in the database. The Orchestrator returns after the age threshold to re-scrape and append the final, mature conversation, creating a chronological timeline.
- **Obsidian Graph Resolution:** Converts URLs pointing to other internal Reddit threads into Obsidian internal links (e.g., `[[Python_1rm32fu]]`).
- **File System Sanitization:** Reddit flairs often include slashes (`/`). The Processor layer sanitizes these into dashes (`-`) to prevent unintended nested directory creation.

### D. DatabaseManager (State Tracking)
Acts as the high-speed SQLite cache (`database.db`).
- Tracks: `id`, `title`, `author`, `source`, `label`, `score`, `post_timestamp`, `file_path`, and `rescrape_after`.
- Controls the footprint limit using `db_limit`, deleting the oldest unneeded records automatically.
- Facilitates the "State Reconciliation Flow" on startup by comparing DB records against the physical `.md` files.

### Context vs. Freshness: The Maturity Logic
Scraping a thread the moment it is posted often misses the best discussion. reddit2md uses the min_age_hours setting to solve this. If a post is young, it is scraped immediately for freshness, but marked as Maturing. The system then automatically returns after the age threshold is met to append the final, mature conversation. Note: If you do not care about post maturity and want every scrape to be final, simply set min_age_hours to 0. This disables all re-scraping logic.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] **`jobs2md`**: Standardize `detail` as a boolean flag (default `false`). Do not alter `reddit2md`'s enum-based `detail` implementation.
- [ ] **`jobs2md`**: During front-matter generation, always inject the `rescrape_after: ` key.
- [ ] **`jobs2md`**: If `detail` is `false` during the scrape, leave `rescrape_after:` empty.
- [ ] **Orchestrator Logic**: Implement a pre-run scan in `jobs2md` that checks existing Markdown files in the output directory. If a file has a populated `rescrape_after` timestamp that is in the past:
  - Extract the job's URL.
  - Execute a targeted JobSpy scrape for that specific URL with `detail: true` (mapping to `linkedin_fetch_description: True`).
  - Overwrite/update the markdown file with the full description and clear the `rescrape_after` field.
```

### AI Analysis & Updated Plan:
- **Understanding**: 
  1. You want to repurpose the `detail` parameter across modules: in `reddit2md` it controls comment depth, while in `jobs2md` it will serve as a boolean flag dictating whether to fetch full job descriptions (specifically for LinkedIn).
  2. You want to port the `rescrape_after` workflow from `reddit2md` over to `jobs2md`. In `reddit2md`, immature posts get stamped with `rescrape_after: <timestamp>` so the system knows to re-fetch and expand them later. In `jobs2md`, if a job is scraped shallowly (`detail: false`), it should output the markdown with an empty `rescrape_after:` field. If the user later decides they want the full job description, they populate that field manually, triggering the orchestrator to re-scrape that specific job with `detail: true`.
- **Review**: This is a brilliant, cohesive architecture. Using the Markdown files themselves as a two-way interface/database queue is extremely powerful. It keeps initial scrapes fast while giving the user granular, on-demand control over data hydration.
- **New Plan**: 
  - Standardize `detail` across modules: as a boolean in `jobs2md` (default: false), and as an enum/size string in `reddit2md`.
  - In `jobs2md` front-matter generation, always include the `rescrape_after: ` key. If `detail: false` during the run, leave it blank.
  - Implement orchestrator logic for `jobs2md` that scans existing Markdown outputs. If it finds a populated, past-due `rescrape_after` field, it parses the `post_url`, fires a targeted JobSpy request with `detail: true` (which maps to `linkedin_fetch_description: True`), and updates the Markdown file.

- `detail` (Enum: XS, SM, MD, LG, XL): Controls the depth and volume of captured comments (e.g., `MD` = Top 8 comments, 2 replies deep).
- `sort` (Enum: new, hot, top, rising): Determines the targeted `.rss` endpoint.
- `min_age_hours` (Integer): The delay for maturity logic. Set to 0 to disable.
- `label`, `blacklist_terms`, `blacklist_urls`: Search and output filters.

1. Config (Settings Management): Handles the logic for merging `settings` with task-specific settings and applying CLI/Python overrides based on the Precedence Order. Validates parameter types.
2. Client (Network Operations): Strictly isolates API and network logic. Manages authentication, headers (e.g., browser-mimicking), rate limiting, and pagination. It should return raw or semi-raw data.
3. Processor (Data Sanitization & Translation): The pure data translation layer. It takes the messy API response from the Client and strictly maps it to the "Standard Schema". It also handles the logic for internal Obsidian link resolution.
4. DatabaseManager (State Tracking): Manages the SQLite index. Responsible for cache pruning, maintaining the `rescrape_after` maturity logic, and executing the State Reconciliation Flow on startup.
5. Scraper / Orchestrator (The Execution Loop): The main entry point. Iterates through the routine queue, coordinates the Config, Client, Processor, and DatabaseManager, and ultimately writes the final Markdown and JSON files to the disk using a Theme Engine / Templates.

Scrapers must allow users to suppress side effects or limit footprints:
- verbose (Integer): Controls the level of terminal output across all modules and the orchestrator.
    - 0: Errors only (Silent operation).
    - 1: Basic progress and warnings (Recommended default).
    - 2: Granular debug and trace information.
- save_json (Boolean): Whether to persist the sanitized JSON data after processing.
- md_log (Boolean): Whether to append the run results to the human-readable Markdown log.
- db_limit (Integer): Maximum number of records to keep in the SQLite index. Older records are pruned to keep the database size manageable.
- min_age_hours (Integer): Defines the minimum age for a post. Can act as a trigger for maturity logic (queueing for rescrape) or as a direct filter. Setting this to 0 disables maturity/re-scraping logic, making every scrape final.
- max_age_hours (Integer): The maximum age of a post to be considered relevant. Anything older is entirely ignored. 
- offset (Integer): Discards the first N results from the source feed before the scraper begins processing.

1. Scan Directory: Recursively scan the md_output_directory for all .md files.
2. Verify Ownership: For each file, parse the front-matter. If the post_id field is missing, skip the file entirely (it belongs to the user, not the scraper).
3. Conflict Resolution: Compare the category and rescrape_after values in the Markdown file against the SQLite database. If they differ, the Markdown file wins, so update the database record immediately.
4. Orphan Pruning: Check for records in the SQLite database where the corresponding Markdown file no longer exists on disk. Delete these records from the database (the user has forgotten the post).

### Context vs. Freshness (Maturity Logic)
To balance the need for immediate updates with the desire for deep context, modules must implement Maturity Logic.
1. Fresh Scrape: A new post is scraped immediately but marked with a future rescrape_after timestamp in the DB and the Markdown front-matter.
2. Maturation: Once that time passes, the module re-fetches the thread, updates the metadata (e.g., new score/metrics), and appends the finalized conversation to the file.
3. Disablement: Setting min_age_hours to 0 must disable this entirely, making every scrape final.

### Age Restrictions (`min_age_hours` / `max_age_hours`)
You can narrow down job listings by how recently they were posted:
- `min_age_hours`: Filters out any jobs posted *more recently* than this limit (e.g., skip jobs posted in the last 2 hours).
- `max_age_hours`: Filters out any jobs older than this limit (e.g., only show jobs from the last 72 hours).

## Proof of concept usage from Sandman layer
Sandman layer uses the same interfaces (python, CLI, config files, etc.) so just like we can queue our default routine and global settings defaults in our config file in the module, we can do the same in sandman like so:
```yaml
{
    "settings": {
        "debug": false,
        "md_output_directory": "../../workspace/feeds/reddit",
        "md_log": "../../workspace/data/reddit/scrape_log.md",
        "data_output_directory": "../../workspace/data/reddit/",
        "group_by_source": true,
        "min_age_hours": 0,
        "min_score": 20,
        "max_results": 10,
    },
    routine: [
        {
            "name": "Python-related jobs from indeed and glassdoor",
            "module": "jobs2md",
            "sources": ["indeed", "glassdoor"],
            "query": "python",
            "max_age_days": 14,
            "is_remote": true
        },
        {

            "max_results": 10,
            "is_remote": true

## 2. Key Limitation & Technical Strategy
**Limitation:** Scraping Reddit without Official API Access (No OAuth tokens).
- **Discovery via RSS:** Standard `.json` index feeds for subreddits are heavily rate-limited and cached when accessed without an API key. To bypass this, the Client uses Reddit's `.rss` endpoints (e.g., `reddit.com/r/python/new/.rss`) to discover new `post_id`s reliably.
- **Deep Fetch via JSON:** Once a `post_id` is discovered via RSS, the Client fetches the full thread (including comments) using the individual post's `.json` endpoint (e.g., `reddit.com/comments/{post_id}.json`), which is less restricted.
- **Graceful Degradation:** The network client gracefully detects if the external `requests` library is installed. If available, it utilizes `requests` to bypass advanced anti-bot measures (e.g., Reddit's 403 Forbidden blocks). If not, it falls back to the standard library `urllib`.
- **Maturity Logic (The Living Note):** Implements a `min_age_hours` check. Threads scraped while young are marked as "Maturing" in the database. The Orchestrator returns after the age threshold to re-scrape and append the final, mature conversation, creating a chronological timeline.
- **Obsidian Graph Resolution:** Converts URLs pointing to other internal Reddit threads into Obsidian internal links (e.g., `[[Python_1rm32fu]]`).
- **File System Sanitization:** Reddit flairs often include slashes (`/`). The Processor layer sanitizes these into dashes (`-`) to prevent unintended nested directory creation.

- `max_results` (Integer): Maximum threads to fetch per feed run.
- `detail` (Enum: XS, SM, MD, LG, XL): Controls the depth and volume of captured comments (e.g., `MD` = Top 8 comments, 2 replies deep).
- `sort` (Enum: new, hot, top, rising): Determines the targeted `.rss` endpoint.
- `min_age_hours` (Integer): The delay for maturity logic. Set to 0 to disable.
- `label`, `blacklist_terms`, `blacklist_urls`: Search and output filters.
- `group_by_source` (Boolean): Organizes output dynamically.

### D. DatabaseManager (State Tracking)
Acts as the high-speed SQLite cache (`database.db`).
- Tracks: `id`, `title`, `author`, `source`, `label`, `score`, `post_timestamp`, `file_path`, and `rescrape_after`.
- Controls the footprint limit using `db_limit`, deleting the oldest unneeded records automatically.
- Facilitates the "State Reconciliation Flow" on startup by comparing DB records against the physical `.md` files.

### E. Orchestrator / Scraper (The Execution Loop)
The main entry point (`scraper.py`) that coordinates the other four buckets.
- **State Validation:** Runs `validate_state()` on startup to prune orphaned DB records (where the `.md` file was deleted by the user) or rebuild the DB entirely from `.md` files if the cache was lost.
- **Routine Loop:** Iterates through the routine defined in `config.yml`.
- **Maturity Loop:** Queries the DB for posts where `rescrape_after` is past the current time, fetches them again, and triggers the Processor's update logic.
- **Output Routing:** Detects whether a scraped post is new or "maturing" and routes it to the correct template behavior (writing a new file vs. regex-replacing the frontmatter and appending a `## Updated Comments` block).

### The Multi-Layer Source of Truth
reddit2md uses a tripartite authority model to ensure data integrity:
- Markdown Files (The Authority): The ultimate source of truth. If you edit the label or rescrape_after date in your Obsidian note, the system detects this on the next run and updates the database. Deleting a note tells the system to forget the post entirely.
- SQLite Database (The Memory): Acts as a high-speed cache and state-tracker. It handles the logic for maturity delays and history. The DB is self-healing—if deleted, it will automatically rebuild itself by scanning your Markdown folders.
- JSON Archive (The Backup): Stores sanitized data for every scrape. This allows for a total vault rebuild without re-querying Reddit if your Markdown files are ever lost.

### Context vs. Freshness: The Maturity Logic
Scraping a thread the moment it is posted often misses the best discussion. reddit2md uses the min_age_hours setting to solve this. If a post is young, it is scraped immediately for freshness, but marked as Maturing. The system then automatically returns after the age threshold is met to append the final, mature conversation. Note: If you do not care about post maturity and want every scrape to be final, simply set min_age_hours to 0. This disables all re-scraping logic.
